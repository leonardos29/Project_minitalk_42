# Project_minitalk_42
Minitalk is a small client-server program that communicates using only UNIX signals (SIGUSR1, SIGUSR2). The client sends messages bit by bit, and the server reconstructs them in real time. This project focuses on low-level C programming, signal handling, inter-process communication, and bitwise operations.
